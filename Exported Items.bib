	abstract = {Developing effective energy resource management strategies in the smart grid is challenging due to the entities on both the demand and supply sides experiencing numerous fluctuations. In this paper, we address the issue of quantifying uncertainties on the energy demand side. Specifically, we first develop approaches using statistical modeling analysis to derive a statistical distribution of energy usage. We then utilize several machine learning based approaches such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and neural networks to carry out accurate forecasting on energy usage. We perform extensive experiments of our proposed approaches using a real-world meter reading data set. Our experimental data shows that the statistical distribution of meter reading data can be largely approximated with a Gaussian distribution and the two SVM-based machine learning approaches to achieve a high accuracy of forecasting energy usage. Extensions to other smart grid applications (e.g., forecasting energy generation, determining optimal demand response, and anomaly detection of malicious energy usage) are discussed as well.},

	abstract = {Like many cities around the world, New York City is establishing policies to reduce CO2 emissions from all energy sectors by 2050. Understanding the impact of varying degrees of electric vehicle adoption and CO2 intensities on emissions reduction in the city is critical. Here, using a technology-rich, bottom-up, energy system optimization model, we analyse the cost and air emissions impacts of New York City’s proposed CO2 reduction policies for the transportation sector through a scenario framework. Our analysis reveals that the electrification of light-duty vehicles at earlier periods is essential for deeper reductions in air emissions. When further combined with energy efficiency improvements, these actions contribute to CO2 reductions under the scenarios of more CO2-intense electricity. Substantial reliance on fossil fuels and a need for structural change pose challenges to cost-effective CO2 reductions in the transportation sector. Here we find that uncertainties associated with decarbonization of the electric grid have a minimum influence on the cost-effectiveness of CO2 reduction pathways for the transportation sector.},

	abstract = {The UK has set plans to increase offshore wind capacity from 22GW to 154GW by 2030. With such tremendous growth, the sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in order to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and profitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are predominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and maintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical role throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and decommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI for the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is analyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and academia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes a detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required to support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed analysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to barriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance and reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in autonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations and optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between people and autonomous assistants. Our study concludes with identification of technological priorities and outlines their integration into a new ‘symbiotic digital architecture’ to deliver the future of offshore wind farm lifecycle management.},

	abstract = {In the present work, a comprehensive numerical model was developed to predict the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore wind farms. A case study is further performed based on the potential developments at the offshore area of the New York State. In the present work, some specific local limitations in the United States are considered by following in line with the present European development experience. A ten-year historical wind data set is used to evaluate the wind farm energy production. The effects of distance to shore, rated power, life span, operation height, farm capacity and seasonal operation plan on LCOE are evaluated. An optimal site giving an LCOE of 123.4 \$2018/MWh is found in this paper. In addition, a novel factor named as wind farm energy density (WFED) is suggested in the present study. It shows that when considering the limited coastal area as an issue, a large capacity wind farm may not have good performance compared with a lower capacity wind farm in terms of energy production. The 508 MW wind farm has a better WFED compared with either a 330 MW wind farm or an 800 MW wind farm under the current investigation.},

	abstract = {The traditional optimization of a wind farm layout consisted of arranging the wind turbines inside a designated area. In contrast, the 2021 tender from the UK government, Offshore Wind Leasing Round 4 (‘‘UK Round-4’’), and upcoming bids only specify large regions where the wind farm can be built. This leads to the new challenge of selecting the wind farm shape and area out of a larger region to maximize its profitability. We introduce this problem as the ‘‘wind farm area selection problem’’ and present a novel optimization framework to solve it efficiently. Specifically, our framework combines three scales of design: (i) on a macro-scale, choosing the approximate location of the wind farm out of larger regions, (ii) on a meso-scale, generating the optimal shape of the wind farm, and (iii) on a micro-scale, choosing the exact position of the turbines within the shape. In particular, we propose a new constructive heuristic to choose the best shape of a wind farm at the mesoscale, which is scarcely studied in the literature. Moreover, while macro and micro-scales have already been investigated, our framework is the first to integrate them. We perform a detailed computational analysis using real-life data and constraints from the recent UK Round-4 tender. Compared to the best rectangular-shaped wind farm at the same location, our results show that optimizing the shape increases profitability by 1.1\% on average and up to 2.8\%, corresponding to 46 and 109 million Euro respectively.},

Electricity remains the largest source of energy used by buildings, and the demand for it is growing. Building energy improvement strategies is needed to mitigate the impact of growing energy demand. Introducing a smart energy management system in buildings is an ambitious yet increasingly achievable goal that is gaining momentum across geographic regions and corporate markets in the world due to its potential in saving energy costs consumed by the buildings. This paper presents a Smart Building Energy Management system (SBEMS), which is connected to a bidirectional power network. The smart building has both thermal and electrical power loops. Renewable energy from wind and photo-voltaic, battery storage system, auxiliary boiler, a fuel cell-based combined heat and power system, heat sharing from neighboring buildings, and heat storage tank are among the main components of the smart building. A constraint optimization model has been developed for the proposed SBEMS and the state-of-the-art real coded genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The main characteristics of the proposed SBEMS are emphasized through eight simulation cases, taking into account the various conﬁgurations of the smart building components. In addition, EV charging is also scheduled and the outcomes are compared to the unscheduled mode of charging which shows that scheduling of Electric Vehicle charging further enhances the cost-effectiveness of smart building operation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique was to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gap in the literature is due to the advancements in the technology and drawbacks of the optimization algorithms and the introduction of different new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms which have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. The detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.},

	abstract = {Global buildings account for about 30\% of the total energy consumption and carbon emission, raising severe energy and environmental concerns. Therefore, it is signiﬁcant and urgent to develop novel smart building energy management (SBEM) technologies for the advance of energy-efﬁcient and green buildings. However, it is a nontrivial task due to the following challenges. Firstly, it is generally difﬁcult to develop an explicit building thermal dynamics model that is both accurate and efﬁcient enough for building control. Secondly, there are many uncertain system parameters (e.g., renewable generation output, outdoor temperature, and the number of occupants). Thirdly, there are many spatially and temporally coupled operational constraints. Fourthly, building energy optimization problems can not be solved in real-time by traditional methods when they have extremely large solution spaces. Fifthly, traditional building energy management methods have respective applicable premises, which means that they have low versatility when confronted with varying building environments. With the rapid development of Internet of Things technology and computation capability, artiﬁcial intelligence technology ﬁnd its signiﬁcant competence in control and optimization. As a general artiﬁcial intelligence technology, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is promising to address the above challenges. Notably, the recent years have seen the surge of DRL for SBEM. However, there lacks a systematic overview of different DRL methods for SBEM. To ﬁll the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DRL for SBEM from the perspective of system scale. In particular, we identify the existing unresolved issues and point out possible future research directions.},

	abstract = {Electric power forecasting plays a substantial role in the administration and balance of current power systems. For this reason, accurate predictions of service demands are needed to develop better programming for the generation and distribution of power and to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in the integration of an electric power system. For the purposes of the current study, a systematic literature review was applied to identify the type of model that has the highest propensity to show precision in the context of electric power forecasting. The state-of-the-art model in accurate electric power forecasting was determined from the results reported in 257 accuracy tests from ﬁve geographic regions. Two classes of forecasting models were compared: classical statistical or mathematical (MSC) and machine learning (ML) models. Furthermore, the use of hybrid models that have made signiﬁcant contributions to electric power forecasting is identiﬁed, and a case of study is applied to demonstrate its good performance when compared with traditional models. Among our main ﬁndings, we conclude that forecasting errors are minimized by reducing the time horizon, that ML models that consider various sources of exogenous variability tend to have better forecast accuracy, and ﬁnally, that the accuracy of the forecasting models has signiﬁcantly increased over the last ﬁve years.},

Therefore, electricity forecasting is a very important task. It allows for better planning and management of energy resources. Several methods have been proposed to forecast energy consumption. In this work, to predict monthly electricity consumption for the economic sector, we develop a novel approach based on ensemble learning. Our approach combines three models that proved successful in the ﬁeld, namely: Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit neural networks, and Temporal Convolutional Networks. The experiments have been conducted with almost 2000 clients and 14 years of monthly electricity consumption from Bejaia, Algeria. The results show that the proposed ensemble models achieve better performance than both the company's requirements and the prediction of the traditional individual models. Finally, statistical tests have been carried out to prove that signiﬁcance of the ensemble models developed.},

However, achieving such objectives in the residential sector, the primary driver of peak demand, is challenging given this sector’s pattern of constantly ﬂuctuating and gradually increasing energy usage. Although deep learning algorithms have recently yielded promising results in various time series analyses, their potential applicability to forecasting monthly residential electricity demand has yet to be fully explored. As such, this study proposed a forecasting model with social and weather-related variables by introducing long short-term memory (LSTM), which has been known to be powerful among deep learning-based approaches for time series forecasting. The validation of the proposed model was performed using a set of data spanning 22 years in South Korea. The resulting forecasting performance was evaluated on the basis of six performance measures. Further, this model’s performance was subjected to a comparison with the performance of four benchmark models. The performance of the proposed model was exceptional according to all of the measures employed. This model can facilitate improved decision-making regarding power-system planning by accurately forecasting the electricity demands of the residential sector, thereby contributing to the eﬃcient production and use of resources.},

	abstract = {The electricity consumption forecasting is a challenging task, because the predictive accuracy is easily affected by multiple external factors, such as society, economics, environment, as well as the renewable energy, including hydro power, wind power and solar power. Particularly, in the smart grid with large amount of data, how to extract valuable information of those external factors timely is the key to the success of electricity consumption forecasting. A method of probability density forecasting based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-Quantile Regression Neural Network (LASSO-QRNN) is proposed in this paper. First, important features are extracted from external factors affecting the electricity consumption forecasting by LASSO regression. Then, the LASSO-QRNN model is constructed to predict annual electricity consumption. The results of electricity consumption forecasting under different quantiles in the next several years are evaluated. Besides, we introduce kernel density estimation into our LASSO-QRNN model, which can give a probability distribution instead of a single-valued prediction. The prediction accuracy is evaluated through the empirical analyses from the Guangdong province dataset in China and the California dataset in the United States. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides better performance for electricity consumption forecasting, in comparison with existing quantile regression neural network (QRNN), back-propagation of errors neural network (BP), radial basis function neural network (RBF), quantile regression (QR) and nonlinear quantile regression (NLQR). LASSO-QRNN can not only better learn the high-dimensional data in electricity consumption forecasting, but also provide more precise results.},

Though many STLF methods were proposed over the past decades, most of them focused on loads at high aggregation levels only. Thus, lowaggregation load forecast still requires further research and development. Compared with the substation or city level loads, individual loads are typically more volatile and much more challenging to forecast. To further address this issue, this paper first discusses the characteristics of small-and-medium enterprise (SME) and residential loads at different aggregation levels and quantifies their predictability with approximate entropy. Various STLF techniques, from the conventional linear regression to state-of-the-art deep learning, are implemented for a detailed comparative analysis to verify the forecasting performances as well as the predictability using an Irish smart meter dataset. In addition, the paper also investigates how using data processing improves individual-level residential load forecasting with low predictability. Effectiveness of the discussed method is validated with numerical results.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of ⩾ 1 week, of electricity consumption proﬁles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a signiﬁcant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to longterm prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building’s schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions diﬃcult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for diﬀerent types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep NN to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building’s load proﬁles, the proposed RNN sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multilayered perceptron model.},

	abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) in building automation and control (BAC) applications is challenged by difficulties in constructing accurate building models and handling uncertain disturbances. An adaptive robust model predictive control (ARMPC) is proposed to refine building models and handle uncertainty of disturbances. A model adaptation function is incorporated to perform online estimation of uncertain parameters of the building model using online measured building operation data, as the MPC controller is in operation. An additive uncertainty model to represent uncertainties of disturbances is integrated with the building model for robust optimization. The control performance of the ARMPC is compared with MPC controllers without adaptive modelling and robust optimization, as well as a conventional thermostat through simulation constructed based on a test building. When an energy-saving-biased setting is applied, ARMPC achieves the best thermal comfort performance among the tested controllers. The energy savings achieved by the ARMPC vary from ≈20\% to ≈15\%, compared to the thermostat, as uncertainty level of internal load increases from 0\% to 60\%. MPC controllers without adaptive modelling and robust optimization maintain ≈20\% energy savings as the uncertainty level increases but at the expense of compromising thermal comfort. When a thermal-comfort-biased setting is applied, the MPC controllers maintain the indoor predicted mean vote (PMV) within a narrow range around thermal neutrality while achieving energy savings of around 10\%, compared to the thermostat. The adaptive modelling and robust optimization of the ARMPC prevent the indoor condition from violating the constrains due to model inaccuracy and uncertainties in measured disturbances.},

To inherent uncertainty in weather that affects control accuracy, this paper develops a data-driven robust model predictive control (DDRMPC) approach for greenhouse temperature control. The dynamic model is obtained from thermal resistance-capacitance modeling derived by the Building Resistance-Capacitance Modeling (BRCM) toolbox. Uncertainty sets of ambient temperature and solar radiation are captured by support vector clustering technique, and they are further tuned for better quality by training-calibration procedure. A case study that implements the carefully chosen uncertainty sets on robust model predictive control shows that the DDRMPC has better control performance compared to rule-based control, certainty equivalent MPC, and robust MPC.},

	abstract = {The optimal design of a building and city, including the balance of their energy performance, must include requirements from a wide range of areas, especially electrical engineering, informatics, technical equipment of buildings, construction and architecture, psychology and many other ﬁelds. It is the optimal design, simulation and modelling that are most reﬂected in the energy requirements of buildings while meeting the requirements of energy sustainability. The impact of buildings and cities on the environment is crucial and unmistakable. It should be emphasized that an inappropriately (architecturally or technologically) designed building with state-of-the-art control technology will still have worse properties than an optimally designed building without a control system. This inspired us to design a building energy model (BEM) with the implementation of a Smart Grid in a decentralized sustainable energy system, which is a microgrid from renewable energy sources (RES). This inspired us to conduct an analysis of simulation models (simultaneous simulations) to show the possibility of their application in the process of fully satisfying energy needs in a given urban region. The main goal is to design an original methodology for the design of smart “Nearly Zero Energy Buildings” (NZEB) and subsequent energy sustainability solutions. This led us to use Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER), PV*SOL (2D solar software design tool for the photovoltaic system performance), Monte Carlo and DesignBuilder. The EMB was designed based on the Six Sigma design quality management methodology. In the process of integrating Smart Grids with energy efﬁciency solutions for buildings, an original optimization basis was designed for smart buildings and smart urban areas. The proposed EMB was veriﬁed in an experiment.},

	abstract = {The reliability of the power supply depends on the reliability of the structure of the grid. Grid networks are exposed to varying weather events, which makes them prone to faults. There is a growing concern that climate change will lead to increasing numbers and severity of weather events, which will adversely affect grid reliability and electricity supply. Predictive models of electricity reliability have been used which utilize computational intelligence techniques. These techniques have not been adequately explored in forecasting problems related to electricity outages due to weather factors. A model for predicting electricity outages caused by weather events is presented in this study. This uses the back-propagation algorithm as related to the concept of artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs). The performance of the ANN model is evaluated using real-life data sets from Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, and compared with some conventional models. These are the exponential smoothing (ES) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. The results obtained from the ANN model are found to be satisfactory when compared to those obtained from MLR and ES. The results demonstrate that artiﬁcial neural networks are robust and can be used to predict electricity outages with regards to faults caused by severe weather conditions.},

Accurate models for electric power load forecasting are essential to the operation and planning of a utility company. Load forecasts are extremely important for energy suppliers and other participants in electric energy generation, transmission, distribution and markets. This paper presents a review of electricity demand forecasting techniques. The various types of methodologies and models are included in the literature. Load forecasting can be broadly divided into three categories: short-term forecasts which are usually from one hour to one week, medium forecasts which are usually from a week to a year, and long-term forecasts which are longer than a year. Based on the various types of studies presented in these papers, the load forecasting techniques may be presented in three major groups: Traditional Forecasting technique, Modified Traditional Technique and Soft Computing Technique.},

              Background
              
                The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been on the rise for more than a century. Bioenergy crops are seen by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as an essential part of the solution to addressing climate change. To understand the potential impact of shrub willow (

                .
                ) crop in the northeast United States, effective and transparent life cycle assessment of these systems needs to occur.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Here we show, ethanol produced from the fermentation of sugars from hot water extract of willow grown on cropland can sequester 0.012 ± 0.003 kg CO
                2eq
                MJ
                −1
                for a supply system incorporating summer harvest and storage. Despite decreases in soil organic carbon when willow is instead grown on grassland, the produced fuel still can provide significant climate benefits compared to gasoline.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Shrub willow converted to ethanol can be a carbon negative source of transportation fuel when the electricity and heat required for the conversion process are generated from renewable biomass. The sequestration of carbon in the belowground portion of the plants is essential for the negative GHG balance for cropland and low GHG emissions in grassland.},
