	abstract = {Like many cities around the world, New York City is establishing policies to reduce CO2 emissions from all energy sectors by 2050. Understanding the impact of varying degrees of electric vehicle adoption and CO2 intensities on emissions reduction in the city is critical. Here, using a technology-rich, bottom-up, energy system optimization model, we analyse the cost and air emissions impacts of New York City’s proposed CO2 reduction policies for the transportation sector through a scenario framework. Our analysis reveals that the electrification of light-duty vehicles at earlier periods is essential for deeper reductions in air emissions. When further combined with energy efficiency improvements, these actions contribute to CO2 reductions under the scenarios of more CO2-intense electricity. Substantial reliance on fossil fuels and a need for structural change pose challenges to cost-effective CO2 reductions in the transportation sector. Here we find that uncertainties associated with decarbonization of the electric grid have a minimum influence on the cost-effectiveness of CO2 reduction pathways for the transportation sector.},

	abstract = {The UK has set plans to increase offshore wind capacity from 22GW to 154GW by 2030. With such tremendous growth, the sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in order to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and profitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are predominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and maintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical role throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and decommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI for the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is analyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and academia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes a detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required to support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed analysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to barriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance and reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in autonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations and optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between people and autonomous assistants. Our study concludes with identification of technological priorities and outlines their integration into a new ‘symbiotic digital architecture’ to deliver the future of offshore wind farm lifecycle management.},

	abstract = {In the present work, a comprehensive numerical model was developed to predict the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore wind farms. A case study is further performed based on the potential developments at the offshore area of the New York State. In the present work, some specific local limitations in the United States are considered by following in line with the present European development experience. A ten-year historical wind data set is used to evaluate the wind farm energy production. The effects of distance to shore, rated power, life span, operation height, farm capacity and seasonal operation plan on LCOE are evaluated. An optimal site giving an LCOE of 123.4 \$2018/MWh is found in this paper. In addition, a novel factor named as wind farm energy density (WFED) is suggested in the present study. It shows that when considering the limited coastal area as an issue, a large capacity wind farm may not have good performance compared with a lower capacity wind farm in terms of energy production. The 508 MW wind farm has a better WFED compared with either a 330 MW wind farm or an 800 MW wind farm under the current investigation.},

	abstract = {The traditional optimization of a wind farm layout consisted of arranging the wind turbines inside a designated area. In contrast, the 2021 tender from the UK government, Offshore Wind Leasing Round 4 (‘‘UK Round-4’’), and upcoming bids only specify large regions where the wind farm can be built. This leads to the new challenge of selecting the wind farm shape and area out of a larger region to maximize its profitability. We introduce this problem as the ‘‘wind farm area selection problem’’ and present a novel optimization framework to solve it efficiently. Specifically, our framework combines three scales of design: (i) on a macro-scale, choosing the approximate location of the wind farm out of larger regions, (ii) on a meso-scale, generating the optimal shape of the wind farm, and (iii) on a micro-scale, choosing the exact position of the turbines within the shape. In particular, we propose a new constructive heuristic to choose the best shape of a wind farm at the mesoscale, which is scarcely studied in the literature. Moreover, while macro and micro-scales have already been investigated, our framework is the first to integrate them. We perform a detailed computational analysis using real-life data and constraints from the recent UK Round-4 tender. Compared to the best rectangular-shaped wind farm at the same location, our results show that optimizing the shape increases profitability by 1.1\% on average and up to 2.8\%, corresponding to 46 and 109 million Euro respectively.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption in buildings is expected to increase by 40\% over the next 20 years. Electricity remains the largest source of energy used by buildings, and the demand for it is growing. Building energy improvement strategies is needed to mitigate the impact of growing energy demand. Introducing a smart energy management system in buildings is an ambitious yet increasingly achievable goal that is gaining momentum across geographic regions and corporate markets in the world due to its potential in saving energy costs consumed by the buildings. This paper presents a Smart Building Energy Management system (SBEMS), which is connected to a bidirectional power network. The smart building has both thermal and electrical power loops. Renewable energy from wind and photo-voltaic, battery storage system, auxiliary boiler, a fuel cell-based combined heat and power system, heat sharing from neighboring buildings, and heat storage tank are among the main components of the smart building. A constraint optimization model has been developed for the proposed SBEMS and the state-of-the-art real coded genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The main characteristics of the proposed SBEMS are emphasized through eight simulation cases, taking into account the various conﬁgurations of the smart building components. In addition, EV charging is also scheduled and the outcomes are compared to the unscheduled mode of charging which shows that scheduling of Electric Vehicle charging further enhances the cost-effectiveness of smart building operation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique was to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gap in the literature is due to the advancements in the technology and drawbacks of the optimization algorithms and the introduction of different new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms which have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. The detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.},

	abstract = {Global buildings account for about 30\% of the total energy consumption and carbon emission, raising severe energy and environmental concerns. Therefore, it is signiﬁcant and urgent to develop novel smart building energy management (SBEM) technologies for the advance of energy-efﬁcient and green buildings. However, it is a nontrivial task due to the following challenges. Firstly, it is generally difﬁcult to develop an explicit building thermal dynamics model that is both accurate and efﬁcient enough for building control. Secondly, there are many uncertain system parameters (e.g., renewable generation output, outdoor temperature, and the number of occupants). Thirdly, there are many spatially and temporally coupled operational constraints. Fourthly, building energy optimization problems can not be solved in real-time by traditional methods when they have extremely large solution spaces. Fifthly, traditional building energy management methods have respective applicable premises, which means that they have low versatility when confronted with varying building environments. With the rapid development of Internet of Things technology and computation capability, artiﬁcial intelligence technology ﬁnd its signiﬁcant competence in control and optimization. As a general artiﬁcial intelligence technology, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is promising to address the above challenges. Notably, the recent years have seen the surge of DRL for SBEM. However, there lacks a systematic overview of different DRL methods for SBEM. To ﬁll the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DRL for SBEM from the perspective of system scale. In particular, we identify the existing unresolved issues and point out possible future research directions.},
